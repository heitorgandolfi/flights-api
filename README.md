This project is a Flight API <b>being developed</b> to strengthen programming concepts and explore new technologies. The API is built using Bun, Elysia.js, and Prisma.

- **Bun**: A runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code outside of the browser environment. It provides a platform for building server-side applications and APIs with ease.
- **Elysia.js**: A powerful framework, supercharged by Bun runtime, static code analysis, and dynamic code injection, being one of the top-performing TypeScript frameworks.
- **Prisma**: A modern database toolkit, simplifying database access with type-safe queries and automatic schema migrations.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run server.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.36. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
